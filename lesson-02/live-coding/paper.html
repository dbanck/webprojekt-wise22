Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus — an updated intrim review and lessons from
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Abstract Background The rapid spread of the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the
biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be
comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make
therapeutic decisions. Methods Based on recently published literatures, official
documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and
origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of
2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) infection. Results The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a
high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and
a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS
and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS
and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more
exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir,
chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when
possible). Conclusion The initial experience from the current pandemic and
lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness
plans and combat disease progression. Keywords
2019-nCoVCOVID-19SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoVMERS-CoV Introduction In late December 2019,
a pneumonia outbreak of unknown etiology took place in Wuhan, Hubei province,
China, and spread quickly nationwide. Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CCDC) identified a novel beta-coronavirus called 2019-nCoV, now
officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
(Gorbalenya et al., 2020), that responsible for the pandemic. This was the third
zoonotic coronavirus breakout in the first two decades of 21st century that
allowing human-to-human transmission and raising global health concerns. Chinese
government had taken immediate, transparent and extraordinary measures, and
reached initial achievements to control the outbreak. As of 11 March 2020, the
pandemic caused accumulated 80955 confirmed cases and 3162 deaths in China,
37364 confirmed cases and 1130 deaths in 113 other countries worldwide. World
Health Organization (WHO) deeply concerned the unprecedented swift global spread
and severity of the outbreak, and by ignorance and inaction of some countries.
Therefore, WHO announced the COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic (WHO,
2020a). Biological features of 2019-nCoV and experiences combating COVID-19
should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help
optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. What’s more, the
2019-nCoV demonstrated partial resemblance with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in
phylogenetic analysis, clinical manifestations and pathological findings.
Scientific advances from the SARS and MERS outbreaks can provide valuable
insight into rapid understanding and control measures of the current pandemic.
We searched literatures and guidelines in Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI,
Wanfang, VIP, preprint bioRxiv and medRxiv databases from the earliest available
date to 11 March, 2020. Initial search terms were "2019-nCoV" OR “2019 novel
coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "COVID-19" OR "corona virus disease 2019" OR
"NCP" OR "Novel coronavirus pneumonia". Further search words were above
keywords, "SARS" OR "SARS-CoV" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome", "MERS" OR
"MERS-CoV" OR "middle east respiratory syndrome", in combinations of with "spike
protein" OR "genome" OR "reproductive number" OR "incubation period" OR "serial
interval" OR "fatality rate" OR "clinical characteristics" OR "pathology" OR
"autopsy" OR "treatment". Moreover, official documents and news released by
National Health Commission of P.R. China, CCDC, CDC(USA) and WHO were accessed
for up-to-date information on COVID-19. Only the articles in English or Chinese
were considered. In this review, we highlight the pandemic potential and
pathological indications of emerging coronavirus, comprehensively and
systematically summarize the up-to-date knowledge of the biological
characteristics of 2019-nCoV, including virology and origin, epidemiology,
clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment. Because of its natural
structures and biological features to bind receptors on host cells, the spike
protein of 2019-nCoV may played an essential role in disease spreading. We
summarized all of the four available pathology studies of COVID-19 biopsy and
autopsy, and compared the results with previous two deadly coronavirus diseases.
New therapeutic measures are emerging one after another. Potential effective
treatments were remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and
vaccine immunization (when possible). Evidence-based medicine should always be
advocated to guide our clinical decision.
